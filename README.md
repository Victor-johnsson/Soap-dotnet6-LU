I tried using SoapUI and gave it the link to the asmx endpoint. That worked flawelessly.

Then i created a console client (SoapClient).
To this I added a service reference (WCF) where i pointed to the asmx endpoint. 
This created the ServiceReference1 under ConnectedServices. Check program.cs for use.
